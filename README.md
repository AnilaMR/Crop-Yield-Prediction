# Crop-Yield-Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting crop yields based on various environmental and agricultural factors. The prediction model is deployed using a Streamlit web application.

Project Overview
Agricultural productivity is influenced by numerous factors such as rainfall, temperature, and pesticide use. This project leverages these factors to build a predictive model that estimates crop yields for different countries and crops.
Files and Structure
app.py: This file contains the code for the Streamlit web application. It allows users to input relevant features and obtain predictions for crop yields.
project.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook details the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of the predictive model.
dtr.pkl and preprocesser.pkl: These are the pickled files for the trained Decision Tree Regressor model and the preprocessor, respectively.
